# Since we implemented this to work with sparse labels 
# (as in our training data), we have to add a check if 
# they are one-hot encoded and handle it a bit differently 
# in this new case. 
# 
# The check can be performed by counting 
# the dimensions â€” if targets are single-dimensional (like 
# a list), they are sparse, but if there are 2 dimensions 
# (like a list of lists), then there is a set of one-hot 
# encoded vectors.
